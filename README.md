# Microsoft-Code.fun.do-2016

### Abstract :

In the world of technology it does not make any sense that humans have to do repetative boring job. One of such job is Hotel Manager where you have to answer to same questions and queries again and again to different coustmers. My idea is to replace human by a chat-bot.

We all know that Coustomer Care is not at all user friendly. No one wants to press 1, then press 7 then press 6 ... It is better to have human like interface. Here chat-bot uses **Microsoft Cognitive Services API** along with **Windows Azure Services** for processing of sentences and replies accordingly.


### How to run :

1. Download project folder.
2. On line 60 enter your Ocp-Apim key. That's it !!!

Open index.html to start using bot.
